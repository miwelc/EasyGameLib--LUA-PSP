Step by step:
------------

1. Put the file "EGLib.lua" in your app folder
2. Insert at the first line of your code:   dofile("EGLib.lua")
3. HOW TO:

a) Pause function:
	Insert in your code:   pause(soundl, timer1, timer2)  when you want to pause the game.
	- Only if you want --> where soundl you can insert a sound name, previously declared. If you don't want just leave it: pause()
	- Only if you want --> where timer1 or timer2 you can insert the name of a timer which you want to be paused
	EX.	if Controls.read():start() then pause(beep) end  -- beep is a sound
		if Controls.read():start() then pause(nil, clock) end  -- This won't play a sound, but this will pause the clock timer while the game is paused

b) ExitGame Menu function:
	Insert in your code:   exit(soundl)  when you want to show the exit menu. At the next line you must insert   if exityes == 1 then break end
	- Only if you want --> where soundl you can insert a sound name, previously declared. If you don't want just leave it: exit()
	- Only if you want --> where timer1 or timer2 you can insert the name of a timer which you want to be paused
	Ex.	if Controls.read():l() then exit(beep, clock) end  -- beep is a sound. This will pause the timer called "clock"
		if exityes == 1 then break end

c) ScaleImage function:
	Insert in your code:   scaleImage(newX, newY, theImage)
	- newx -> Width, newy -> height, theImage -> image   (lol)
	Ex.	screen:blit(10, 10, scaleImage(25, 25, car))

d) RotateImage function:
	Insert in your code:   rotate(image, rotateIndex)
	- image -> image   (lol), rotateIndex -> 0 (0º), 1 (90º right), 2 (180º right), 3 (270º right), 4 (360º right (Of course, an estupid value lol))
	This will rotate the image 90º to the right
	Ex.	screen:blit(5, 5, rotate(car, 2))

e) PrintRotated function:
	Insert in your code:   printRotated(xro, yro, text, color, rotateIndex)
	- xro & yro -> Position, text -> text, color -> color, rotateIndex -> 0, 1, 2, 3 (like the rotateimage function)
	This will print rotated text
	Ex.	printRotated(472, 76, "Hello World", red, 1)

f) PrintCentered function:
	Insert in your code:   printCentered(y, text, color)
	- y -> vertical position, text -> text, color -> color
	Ex.	printCentered(134, "Hello World", red)

g) hFlip & vFlip functions:
	Insert in your code:   hFlip(image)
				or
			       vFlip(image)
	- image -> An image
	This will invert an image vertically (vFlip) or horizantilly (hFlip)
	Ex.	carinv = hFlip(car)

h) Fus function:
	Insert in your code:   fus(image1, image2)
	This will fuse two images. (It's a bit limited)



NOTES:
-----

1. NOW, both pause & exitgame menu functions will pause up to 2 timers.

2. This is a recopilation of functions, the original autors are in the head of the readme.
